KickAnimationsModule Documentation
=====================================

This module manages the animations related to the football kicking action in Roblox. 
It provides functionality for playing animations when the football is kicked.

Dependencies and Services:
--------------------------
- tweenService: Accesses the TweenService to create smooth transitions for the football's position and orientation.

Functions:
----------

1. KickAnimationsModule:KickSnap
   ---------------------------------------------------------
   - Plays the kick animation for the football, moving it and rotating it to simulate a kick action.
   - Parameters:
     - football: The football object that will be animated.
     - startingPosition: The initial position of the football before the kick animation begins.

   - Sets the football to be anchored, preventing it from falling due to gravity during the animation.
   - Changes the football's orientation to simulate the angle of the kick (90 degrees on the Z-axis).
   - Creates a rotation tween that continuously rotates the football around the Z-axis (360 degrees).
     - The rotation duration is set to 0.4 seconds with a linear easing style.
     - The rotation tween is set to play continuously after it completes.
   
   - Creates a movement tween that simulates the football moving backward when kicked.
     - The movement duration is set to 0.5 seconds with a linear easing style, moving the football 15 studs backward and slightly downward.
   
   - Creates a holder rotation tween that resets the football's orientation to 0 degrees on the Z-axis after it has moved.
     - The holder rotation duration is set to 0.3 seconds with a linear easing style.

   - When the movement tween completes:
     - The rotation tween is paused and destroyed to stop further rotation.
     - The holder rotation tween is then played, resetting the football's orientation.

How It Works:
-------------
1. The KickSnap function is called when the kick animation is triggered.
2. The football is anchored and positioned for the animation.
3. Two tweens (rotation and movement) are created to simulate the snapping action.
4. Upon completion of the movement, the rotation is paused, and the holder rotation is activated to reset the football's orientation.
