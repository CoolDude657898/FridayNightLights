KickModuleServer Documentation
========================================

This script manages the server-side logic for football kicking mechanics in Roblox. It initializes the kick setup, 
processes the kick execution, and checks if the kick is successful.

Dependencies and Services:
--------------------------
- serverScriptService: Accesses the ServerScriptService for server-side scripts and classes.
- replicatedStorage: Accesses the ReplicatedStorage service for shared assets and remotes.
- players: Fetches the Players service to interact with player objects.
- classes: References the Classes folder in ServerScriptService, which contains the Football class.
- Football: Loads the Football class, which handles the football object.
- assets: Accesses the Assets folder in ReplicatedStorage for game assets.
- remotes: References the Remotes folder in ReplicatedStorage for server-client communication.
- kickAnimations: Loads the KickAnimations module for handling kick animations.

Functions:
----------

1. kickModuleServer:InitializeKick
   ---------------------------------------------------------
   - Initializes the kick setup at a specific position and orientation based on the specified hash.
   - Parameters:
     - kickPosition: The position where the kick setup will be initialized.
     - hash: A string indicating the kick position (Left, Right, or Middle).

   - Clones the KickSetup asset from assets and parents it to Workspace.
   - Depending on the hash value, it positions the kick setup accordingly:
     - Left: Sets the position to the left of the specified kickPosition.
     - Right: Sets the position to the right of the specified kickPosition.
     - Middle: Sets the position at the center of the specified kickPosition.
   
   - Connects a Touched event to the KickerPad part. When a player touches the KickerPad:
     - Checks if the PlayerUsing attribute is empty and if the touched object has a Humanoid.
     - If true, retrieves the player object and sets the PlayerUsing attribute to the player's name.
     - Fires the SteppedOnPad remote event to the client, indicating that the player is ready to kick.

2. kickModuleServer:Kick
   ---------------------------------------------------------
   - Executes the kick with specified power, vertical angle, and accuracy.
   - Parameters:
     - power: The power value selected by the player for the kick.
     - verticalAngle: The vertical angle at which the player kicks the ball.
     - accuracy: The accuracy value selected by the player for the kick.
     - kickSetup: The kick setup object containing the football.
     - goalposts: The goalposts object used to check if the kick is successful.

   - Creates a new Football object using the football from kickSetup.
   - Plays the kick animation using the KickSnap function from kickAnimations.
   - Waits for 2 seconds to allow the kick animation to finish.
   
   - Connects a Touched event to the IfGoodChecker part of the goalposts:
     - If the touched object matches the kickSetup football, it indicates a successful kick.
   
   - Calls the Kick method on the football object with the specified power, vertical angle, and accuracy.

How It Works:
-------------
1. When the game initializes a kick, the InitializeKick function is called with the kick position and orientation.
2. The kick setup is created and positioned based on the provided hash (Left, Right, or Middle).
3. When a player touches the KickerPad, the player is registered, and the kick preparation is communicated to the client.
4. Once the player finalizes their kick, the Kick function is called with the selected parameters.
5. The football is kicked with the specified power, angle, and accuracy, and a success check is performed against the goalposts.
